LLS_EIGHT_POINT_ALG  computes the fundamental matrix from matching points using 
linear least squares eight point algorithm
Arguments:
    points1 - N points in the first image that match with points2
    points2 - N points in the second image that match with points1

    Both points1 and points2 are from the get_data_from_txt_file() method
Returns:
    F - the fundamental matrix such that (points2)^T * F * points1 = 0
Please see lecture notes and slides to see how the linear least squares eight
point algorithm works

NORMALIZED_EIGHT_POINT_ALG  computes the fundamental matrix from matching points

'''
PLOT_EPIPOLAR_LINES_ON_IMAGES given a pair of images and corresponding points,
draws the epipolar lines on the images
Arguments:
    points1 - N points in the first image that match with points2
    points2 - N points in the second image that match with points1
    im1 - a HxW(xC) matrix that contains pixel values from the first image 
    im2 - a HxW(xC) matrix that contains pixel values from the second image 
    F - the fundamental matrix such that (points2)^T * F * points1 = 0

    Both points1 and points2 are from the get_data_from_txt_file() method
Returns:
    Nothing; instead, plots the two images with the matching points and
    their corresponding epipolar lines. See Figure 1 within the problem set
    handout for an example
